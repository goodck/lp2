# Career Quest Landing Page

This project contains a simple prototype for a game-themed landing page aimed at job seekers in their twenties.
The design uses the "Press Start 2P" pixel font hosted on Google Fonts. The page is written in plain HTML, CSS and a small bit of JavaScript for the form submission alert.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the page.  No build step is required.

## Testing

There are currently no automated tests. Running `npm test` will fail because `package.json` is not included.
